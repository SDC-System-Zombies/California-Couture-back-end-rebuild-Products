# California Couture, back-end rebuild - Products microservice

I worked with a team of engineers to do a back-end rebuild on an online retail database service. As part of the process, we migrated the data from the old service to the new service. We broke out the monolith API service into several microservices.

1. Products
2. Questions & Answers
3. Reviews

This repo is the Products microservice.
